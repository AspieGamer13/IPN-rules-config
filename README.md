Inventory Profiles Next mod - rules config text file

Current Minecraft version: 1.21.6

This document REQUIRES the Inventory Profiles Next mod for Minecraft

The Minecraft version must be the same to avoid errors
  a: for items not yet in game and
  b: to not have items out of order that haven't been added to the file

This document goes in the /config/inventoryprofilesnext folder of your .minecraft folder
  (note: .minecraft can be replaced with where you have your modded game launch from)
